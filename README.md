# WareBotCollect_Group8
This project has been designed to implement an automated order-handling solution in an industrial context. It integrates a robot, GUI, database and order-handling logic.
The solution is programmed to pick-up and place components to complete an order. The order is entered and initiated by the admin. Once the order has been completed, the admin must confirm the completion to process the next order.

There is a total of 17 files consisting of:
- One README
- One sln
- One app.manifest
- Two .axaml
- Two .csproj
- Three files for database sqlite
- Seven .cs
